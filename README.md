# midi-editor (working title)

A modern, pure-SMF MIDI file editor with an embedded MCP server — a "VSCode for MIDI".

- Modern DAW-class UX (gpui), faithful Standard MIDI File round-trip (SysEx, per-event
  channel, same-tick ordering, Shift-JIS text metas preserved byte-exact)
- Track destinations: built-in GM synth / MIDI out ports (loopMIDI, physical) / hosted VST3
- MCP-native: humans and LLM agents edit the same document through one transaction path

Design docs live in `docs/research/` — start with `00-synthesis.md`.

Status: Phase 0 spike (toolchain + architecture verification).
